<h1>[Tutorial] How to Install Type 2 Hypervisor with Oracle VirtualBox</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project will guide the user through creating a virtual machine on Oracle VirtualBox. The operating system that will be demonstrated is Linux Ubuntu, but can be interchanged for other versions of Linux, as well as versions of Windows.
<br />


<h2>Operating Systems and Software Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b> 
- <b>Linux Ubuntu 20.04.01</b>
